# 🚀 Decentralized Crowdfunding DApp

## 📝 Project Description

This project is a **simple Crowdfunding Decentralized Application (DApp)** built using **Solidity** and designed to run on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to contribute ETH to a campaign, while ensuring that funds are only withdrawn by the campaign owner if the funding goal is met.

---

## 🌟 Project Vision

To empower creators, entrepreneurs, and innovators by providing a **transparent and trustless crowdfunding platform** that does not rely on intermediaries or centralized entities.

---

## 🔑 Key Features

- 🧾 **Minimalist Design**: Only 3 core functions — contribute, withdraw, and view campaign details.
- ⏳ **Time-bound Campaigns**: Contributors can donate only until a specified deadline.
- 🛡️ **Goal-Based Withdrawals**: Funds can only be withdrawn by the campaign owner after the goal is reached and the deadline has passed.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

- ✅ Support for **multiple campaigns**.
- 👥 Ability for users to **create their own campaigns**.
- 🔄 **Refund mechanism** for failed campaigns.
- 📈 UI dashboard to show real-time contributions and statistics.
- 🌐 Integrate with **frontend frameworks (React, Next.js)** for full DApp experience.

3. After deadline, owner calls `withdrawFunds()` if the goal is met.
